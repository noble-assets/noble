- In the v8 Helium upgrade handler, the Noble Core Team wanted to align a missconfiguration in the initial genesis file that resulted in 18 surplus $STAKE existing, bringing the total supply to 1,000,000,018. The migration plan involved burning the surplus 18 tokens via the Uupgrade module, however, the module account was never initialized and permissioned.
