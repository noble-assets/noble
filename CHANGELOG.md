# CHANGELOG

## v8.0.2

*Nov 13, 2024*

This is a consensus breaking patch to the v8 Helium release line.

It addresses the following consensus failure when upgrading Noble's mainnet to the `v8.0.1` release.

### BUG FIXES

- Due to IBC-Go v8 not supporting App Wiring, the Noble Core Team has to manually initialize all IBC modules and keepers. The Forwarding module receives multiple IBC keepers, which have to be manually set once wiring is complete. ([#429](https://github.com/noble-assets/noble/pull/429))

## v8.0.1

*Nov 13, 2024*

This is a consensus breaking patch to the v8 Helium release line.

It addresses the following consensus failure when upgrading Noble's mainnet to the `v8.0.0` release.

### BUG FIXES

- In the v8 Helium upgrade handler, the Noble Core Team wanted to align a missconfiguration in the initial genesis file that resulted in 18 surplus $STAKE existing, bringing the total supply to 1,000,000,018. The migration plan involved burning the surplus 18 tokens via the Uupgrade module, however, the module account was never initialized and permissioned. ([#428](https://github.com/noble-assets/noble/pull/428))

## v8.0.0

*Nov 11, 2024*

This is the Helium major release of Noble. It upgrades Noble itself and all of it's core modules to the latest stable release of the Cosmos SDK, `v0.50.x` a.k.a. Eden. Additional module changes have been documented below:

#### FiatTokenFactory

The BlockIBC logic was improved to support both Bech32 and Bech32m for IBC recipient addresses.

#### Florin

The module was updated to accept a user's public key when verifying signatures, instead of relying on on-chain data.

#### Forwarding

The module was updated to include a fallback address and a list of allowed denominations to forward.
